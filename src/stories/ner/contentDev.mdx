## IV. Conditional Random Fields

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are a class of undirected probabilistic models. They have proved to be powerful models with a wide range of applications, including text processing [@Lafferty2001; @Taskar2002; @Peng2004], image recognition [@Kumar2003; @He2004; @Zheng2015; @Teichmann2018], and bioinformatics [@Sato2005; @Liu2006].

While CRFs can have any graph structure, in this article we'll focus on the linear-chain version:

### Markov Random Fields

CRFs are a notable class of Markov Random Fields – probability distributions defined by *undirected* graphs where each node is a random variable:

Undirected graphs are suitable for when it would be difficult or implausible to establish a causal, generative relationship between variables. Voting influence serves as an apt analogy for such relationships. In the graph above, we can think of $A$, $B$, and $C$ as individual voters. $A$ and $B$ are friends and tend to vote similarly. The same goes for $B$ and $C$ as well as $C$ and $A$.

Directed graphs fail to adequately represent the coupled voting behavior within the group. Cyclical configurations like $A$ → $B$ → $C$ → $A$… are out of the question. Any other configuration fails to fully account for all dependencies within the graph. For example, we might have $A$ → $B$ but no path from $B$ → $A$ – there will always be at least one such omission in a directed cyclical graph.

In Markov Random Fields, the relationship between each variable pair is modeled with a scoring function, called a *factor*, that assigns higher scores if the variables’ values are in agreement, for example:

$$
f(x, y) = \begin{cases}
	10\ \textrm{ if $x = 1$ and $y = 1$} \\
	5\ \textrm{ if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$} \\
	0\ \textrm{ otherwise}
	\end{cases}
$$

The graph’s joint probability is a normalized product of all the applicable factors:

$$
p(a,b,c) = \frac{1}{Z}\ f(a,b)\ f(b,c)\ f(c,a)
$$
