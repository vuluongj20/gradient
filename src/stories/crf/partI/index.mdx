## I. Probabilistic Graphical Models

Graphical modeling is a robust framework for representing probabilistic models. Complex, multivariate probability distributions can be represented by compact graphs that are vastly easier to understand and interpret.

### 1. Factorizing Joint Distributions

Let’s start with a simple example with just two random variables, $A$ and $B$. Assume that $B$ is conditionally dependent on $A$. Through a canonical application of the chain rule, the joint distribution of $A$ and $B$ is:

$$
p(a, b) = p(a) \cdot p(b|a)
$$

This is a simple enough example, with just 2 factors in the right hand side. Add more variables, however, and the result can get messy fast. To see this, assume that there are two more variables, $C$ and $D$, and that $D$ is conditionally dependent on $A$, $B$, and $C$. The factorization becomes:

$$
p(a, b, c, d) = p(a) \cdot p(b|a) \cdot p(c) \cdot p(d|a, b, c)
$$

The relationship between variables is more opaque, hidden behind second-order dependencies. For example, while it's clear that $D$ is directly dependent on $A$, it's easy to miss the fact that there is also a second-order dependency between the two ($D$ is dependent on $B$, which in turn is dependent on $A$).

### 2. Directed Acyclic Graphs

Directed Acyclic Graphs, or DAGs, offer a natural solution to this problem. Each factor in the equation can be represented by a node. An arrow indicates conditional dependence. The resulting graph would look like:

With this graph, it's easier to construct a generative story of how $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ are sampled. The process proceeds in [topological order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting), for example $A$ → $C$ → $B$ → $D$, to make sure that all dependencies have been resolved by the time each variable is sampled.
