## I. Probabilistic Graphical Model

Graphical modeling is a robust framework for representing probabilistic models. Complex, multivariate probability distributions can be factored into compact graphical representations that are vastly easier to understand and interpret.

Assume we have two random variables, $X$ and $Y$. Assume further that Y’s probability distribution depends on $X$’s observed value, so we can write it as $p(y|x)$. By a simple rearrangement of the definition of conditional probabilities, we know that the joint distribution for both $X$ and $Y$ is $p(x, y) = p(x)p(y|x)$. We can represent the two terms on the right hand side — $p(x)$ and $p(y|x)$ — using a directed graph with two nodes:
