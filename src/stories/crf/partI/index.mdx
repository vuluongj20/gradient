## I. Probabilistic Graphical Models

Graphical modeling is a powerful and robust framework for representing probabilistic models. Complex, multivariate distributions can be factored into compact graphical representations that are much easier to understand and interpret.

Assume that we have two random variables, $X$ and $Y$. Assume further that $Y$’s probability distribution depends on $X$’s sampled value, so we can write it as $p(y|x)$. The joint distribution for $X$ and $Y$ is $p(x, y) = p(x)p(y|x)$ (derived from a quick rearrangement of the definition of conditional probabilities). The two terms on the right hand side — $p(x)$ and $p(y|x)$ — can be represented by a directed graph with two nodes:
